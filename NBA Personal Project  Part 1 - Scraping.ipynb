    "# Step 1: Building the web scraping algorithm for NBA statistics \n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.a : Defining the question that we want to answer \n",
    "\n",
    "We want to predict the 2023 NBA MVP using a player's seasonal statistical performance (a player's statistical averages over an NBA season). To answer this question we need to define two parameters: the statistical features we want to include in the dataset that we want to build and how many seasons do we want to cover? \n",
    "\n",
    "### What data source did I use to build the dataset?  \n",
    "If we want to scrape seasonal player data, the logical starting place would be to start at this web page: \n",
    "<a id=https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_2022_per_game.html > 2021-22 NBA Player Stats </a>.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "This webpage contains different statistical features (per-game, advanced and shooting) for every NBA player in a given season (in the above link, the 2021-2022 NBA season). \n",
    "<br>\n",
    "I chose this website because it represents the most comprehensive raw basketball database. It is perfect for scraping and building customized datasets for further analysis. It is also rudimentary in terms of HTML structure, making it easier for beginners such as myself to scrape it. \n",
    "\n",
    "### What features did I choose to build the dataset? \n",
    "To build the dataset, we had the choice of features across several categories of data: totals, per-game, per 36-min, per 100 poss, advanced, play-by-play, shooting and adjusted shooting. I chose to only look at per-game and advanced because they cover all of the different performance areas (scoring, shooting, passing, defense, efficiency, etc.), from different angles. This gives us a statistical overview of each player's season while keeping the dataset relatively lean (in terms of columns). I could have used all of the above-mentioned categories but I don't believe it would make for a significantly more meaningful analysis and one that could be easily communicable to audiences. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### How many seasons did I choose to scrape? \n",
    "I think that 20 seasons is a big enough sample size to make for interesting time series analyses (of different statistical trends) while staying in the 'current' era of basketball, where players are more comparable to each other. I could have arguably extended my analysis to the last 30 years but I think you also in yearly comparability once you go back to the 90's and the insights would probably not have been that much more interesting. \n",
    "<br>\n",
    "It is also interesting to mention that the chosen timespan also coincides with the career length of LeBron James. So, If I want to compare the career achievements of various of today's 'great' players, LeBron would force me to look back at least 20 years in the past.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### How is the scraping algorithm structured? \n",
    "The algorithm works in the following way: \n",
    "<ol>\n",
    "    <li>loop through a list of seasons\n",
    "    <li>open the html link of that season's player stats page\n",
    "    <li>parse the html link using BeautifulSoup\n",
    "    <li>extract column headers and table data to build a dataset array\n",
    "    <li>turn the array into a pandas dataframe and append it to a list of dataframes (one per season)\n",
    "    <li>merge of all the seasonal dataframes into a single 20-year dataframe\n",
    "</ol>\n",
