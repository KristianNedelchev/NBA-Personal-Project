# NBA-Personal-Project
I made this project because I wanted to develop my skills in manipulating and analyzing large datasets to draw interesting insights. I believe this type of analysis will be useful in building a solid portfolio for a future role in analytics/data science or even product management.  

I wanted to find a fun dataset to work on and, being a longtime NBA fan, analyzing basketball data was a no-brainer. Seeing as basketball analytics is a very well developed field and there is a large abundance of data available (on Basketball Reference for example), I could have simply downloaded a csv file and imported it in Python to start analyzing it right away. However, I wanted to get more comfortable with scraping data to create custom datasets, so I dedicated part 1 of this project to creating a rudimentary web scraper using BeautifulSoup.
